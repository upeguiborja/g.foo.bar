## Google Foo.Bar Challenge repository

_Date: 2020-03-09_

Repo with my work on the Google Foo Bar challenges with annotations and explanations when possible. Kind of like a little journal of my explorations in math and CS in order to solve each challenge.

> Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...

> Commander Lambda sure is a task-master, isn't she? You're being worked to the bone!
